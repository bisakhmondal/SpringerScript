## Project Name:  SpringerScript

A script to auto Download all the available ebooks provided in th  `Springer Ebooks.pdf`. Thanks to Springer Publication for making such a huge lists of ebooks available at free of cost.

Scrolling to each book's description page and choose to download (Hit `Download` button) or not, is terrible when the number of books is more than 400.
